# What is used
The tables have user-defined Constraints and are connected with complicated relations. One to Many and Many to Many relationships are used in this project.
You can see a couple of Stored Procedures and Triggers in the ManipulationScripts folder, that can help automating the process of insertion and deletion and be used by non-programmers.
